LIFEsim
=======

LIFEsim is the simulator software for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). It simulates
the interferometric measurement of LIFE to demonstrate the capabilities of the observatory. Coupled
with on-sky source simulations, LIFEsim will infer the amount and diversity of exoplanets
observable with LIFE. Inputting spectral information of exoplanets allows for a description of the
spectral measurement potential of LIFE.
